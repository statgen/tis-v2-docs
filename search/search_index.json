This imputation server allows registered users to perform genotype imputation for their own samples. Typically, this allows tens of millions of genetic variants to be genotyped with very high-fidelity in samples that have been genotyped with an affordable genotyping array. Imputation works by comparing short stretches of an individual genome to stretches of previously characterized genomes. Since all humans are related, this process can typically and accurately reconstruct much of the missing data in each genome.</p>"},{"location":"about/#the-topmed-imputation-panel-and-server","title":"The TOPMed Imputation Panel and Server","text":"<p>The TOPMed Imputation Reference panel is a diverse reference panel including information from 133,597 deeply sequenced human genomes.

This reference panel is built on a subset of 133,597 TOPMed samples for whom high quality whole genome sequence data was available and for where contributing studies approved this use of the data, taking into account both the limited risks associated with including a sample in an imputation reference panel that is only available through this imputation server and also other study and sample specific use restrictions.
